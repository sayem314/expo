**`expo-firebase-core`** provides access to the Firebase configuration and performs initialisation
of the native Firebase App.

<PlatformsSection android emulator ios simulator web />

## Installation

<InstallSection packageName="expo-firebase-core" />

## Configuration

To use this package, Firebase needs to be configured for your app.
[Please follow this guide on how to configure native Firebase.](/guides/setup-native-firebase)

> No explicit calls to `expo-firebase-core` are required to initialize Firebase. This library will auto-initialize the Firebase app when a valid configuration exists.

## Native Firebase packages

At the moment, only Firebase Analytics is supported natively. We are working on bringing more native Firebase packages to Expo, stay tuned :)

- [expo-firebase-analytics](firebase-analytics)

## API

```js
import * as FirebaseCore from 'expo-firebase-core';
```

<APISection packageName="expo-firebase-core" apiName="FirebaseCore" />
