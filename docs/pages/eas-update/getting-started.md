Setting up EAS Update allows you to push critical bug fixes and improvements that your users need right away.

## Prerequisites

EAS Update requires the following versions or greater:

- Expo CLI 5.0.0
- EAS CLI 0.41.1
- Expo SDK 44.0.1
- expo-updates 0.11.2

## Install Expo CLI and EAS CLI

1. Install EAS and Expo CLIs with:

   ```bash
   npm install --global eas-cli expo-cli
   ```

## Create an Expo account

1. Create an account at [https://expo.dev/signup](https://expo.dev/signup)
2. Then, log in with EAS CLI:

   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

3. After logging in, you can verify the logged-in account with `eas whoami`.

## Create a project

Create a project with Expo CLI by running:

```bash
expo init
```

## Configure your project

1. Install the latest `expo-updates` library with:

   ```bash
   expo install expo-updates
   ```

2. Initialize your project with EAS Update:

   ```bash
   eas update:configure
   ```

3. To set up the configuration file for builds, run:

   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

   This command will create a file named **eas.json**.

4. Inside the `preview` and `production` build profiles in **eas.json**, add a `channel` property for each:

   ```json
   {
     "build": {
        "preview": {
          "channel": "preview"
          ...
        },
        "production": {
          "channel": "production"
          ...
        }
     }
   }
   ```

   The `channel` allows you to point updates at builds. For example, if we set up a GitHub Action to publish changes on merge, it will make it so that we can merge code into the "production" Git branch. Then, each commit will trigger a GitHub Action that will publish an update that will be available to builds with the channel "production".

5. Optional: If your project is a bare React Native project, [read the doc](/eas-update/bare-react-native) on additional configuration you may need.

## Create a build for the project

Next, we'll need to create a build for Android or iOS. [Learn more](/build/setup).

We recommend creating a build with the `preview` build profile first. [Learn more](/build/internal-distribution) about setting up your devices for internal distribution.

Once you have a build running on your device or in a simulator, we'll be ready to send it an update.

## Make changes locally

Once we've created a build, we're ready to iterate on our project. Start a local development server with:

```bash
yarn start

# or

expo start
```

Then, make any desired changes to your project's JavaScript, styling, or image assets.

## Publish an update

Now we're ready to publish an update to the build created in the previous step.

Then publish an update with the following command:

```bash
eas update --branch [branch] --message [message]

# Example
eas update --branch preview --message "Updating the app"
```

Once the update is built and uploaded to EAS and the command completes, force close and reopen your app up to two times to download and view the update.

> ⚠️ While EAS Update is in "preview" we are only allowing up to 300 assets to be uploaded in a single publish.

## Next

You can publish updates continuously with GitHub Actions. Learn more: [Using GitHub Actions with EAS Update](/eas-update/github-actions)
