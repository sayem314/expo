title: Using expo-updates with a custom updates server
---

EAS (Expo Application Services) is the Expo team's cloud service that can host and serve updates for an Expo app using the `expo-updates` library. In some cases, you may prefer to use your own servers and control how updates are sent to your app. To accomplish this, it's possible to implement your own custom Expo Updates server that will provide update manifests and assets to your end-users' apps.

The only requirement is that your custom server adheres to the [Expo Updates Protocol](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/12461). To help get you started, we created a demo repo that implements the protocol that you could deploy and test.
