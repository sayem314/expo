This guide will help you upload your Expo standalone apps to Apple TestFlight and to Google Play.
You'll need a paid developer account for each platform for which you wish to upload and publish an app. You can create an Apple Developer account on [Apple's developer site](https://developer.apple.com/account/) and a Google Play Developer account on the [Google Play Console sign-up page](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/signup/).

## 1. Build a standalone app

To learn how to build native binaries, see [Creating your first build](/build/setup.md) or [Building on CI](/build/building-on-ci.md).

<details><summary><strong>Are you using the classic build system?</strong> (<InlineCode>expo build:[android|ios]</InlineCode>)</summary> <p>

To learn how to build native binaries, see [Building Standalone Apps](/classic/building-standalone-apps.md) or [Building Standalone Apps on Your CI](/classic/turtle-cli.md).

</p>
</details>

## 2. Start the upload

To upload the previously built standalone app to the appropriate app store, you simply run `eas submit -p android` or [`eas submit -p ios`](/submit/introduction.md). However, you have a few options for choosing which app binary you want to upload (remember to choose one at the time):

- `--latest` - uploads the latest build for the given platform found on Expo Servers
- `--url <url>` - uploads a build from given URL
- `--path <path>` - uploads a build from the local file system
- `--id <id>` - uploads a build with the given ID

## 2.1. If you choose to upload your Android app to Google Play

**Important:**

- You have to create a Google Service Account and download its JSON private key.
- After that, you'll have to create an app on [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/) and upload your app manually at least once.

#### Creating a Google Service Account

See [expo.fyi/creating-google-service-account](https://expo.fyi/creating-google-service-account) to learn more.

#### Manually uploading your app for the first time

Before using `eas submit -p android` for uploading your standalone app builds, you have to upload your app manually at least once.<br />
See [expo.fyi/first-android-submission](https://expo.fyi/first-android-submission) to learn more.

#### Using EAS CLI to upload the further builds of your app

After these steps, you can make use of EAS CLI to upload your further app builds to Google Play.

To upload your Android app to Google Play, run `eas submit -p android`. [Learn more about this command](/submit/android.md), and [how to use it with `expo build:android](/submit/classic-builds.md) if you are not using [EAS Build](/build/introduction.md) yet.

## 2.2. If you choose to upload your iOS app to TestFlight


### Using EAS CLI

To upload your iOS app to TestFlight, run `eas submit -p ios`. [Learn more about this command](/submit/ios.md), and [how to use it with `expo build:ios`](/submit/classic-builds.md) if you are not using [EAS Build](/build/introduction.md) yet.

### Manually uploading your app

> This approach only works on macOS. If you don't have access to a macOS device, use EAS Submit.

In order to see your app on Testflight, you will first need to submit your .IPA file to Apple using **Transporter** (previously known as Application Loader), available on the App Store ([link](https://apps.apple.com/app/transporter/id1450874784)). In order to do this:

1. Make sure you have logged into iTunes connect at least once with your Apple ID and accepted the terms.
2. Download Transporter from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/transporter/id1450874784).
3. Sign in with your Apple ID.
4. Add the IPA either by dragging it onto the Transporter window or by selecting it from the file dialog opened with **+** or **Add App** button.
5. Submit the IPA by clicking the **Deliver** button.

This process can take a few minutes. After this process is complete, you can check the status of your app submission to TestFlight in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com):

1. Login to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com with your Apple ID and regular password (NOT your app specific password)
2. Select 'My Apps' and you should see your app listed.
3. Click 'TestFlight' from the menu bar at the top.
4. This will show your current app builds that are available for testing.
5. In order to test the app on your device, you will need to install the TestFlight iOS app from the App Store, and sign in using your Apple ID.
