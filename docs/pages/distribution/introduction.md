Distributing your app to your users is a critical process in the development of any product. This documentation will cover topics related to app distribution, such as how to:

- [Create native builds](/build/setup.md) you can submit to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store
- Prepare your app for [deployment to the App Store and Play Store](app-stores.md) and avoid common rejections.
- Manage different [release environments](release-channels.md) for your app
