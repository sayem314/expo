Every app is made up of some combination of React Native, Expo SDK, and third party libraries. It's important to understand how to use the libraries from each of these sources, and how to determine whether a third-party library will work in your project or not.

If you are using the bare workflow, read the [guide for using libraries in the bare workflow](../bare/using-libraries.md) instead of this page.

## Using React Native Core Libraries

React Native provides a set of built-in primitives that most developers will need in their app. These include components such as ActivityIndicator, TextInput, Text, ScrollView, and View. These are listed in the [Core Components and APIs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) page of the React Native documentation. We also list the React Native Core Components and APIs in the [API Reference](/versions/latest/) section of the Expo documentation, so you can quickly see the documentation relevant to the SDK version that your app uses in the same place as you would find it for Expo SDK libraries. You can see the React Native version that corresponds to your Expo SDK version in the table on the [API Reference index](/versions/latest/).

The `react-native` core library is installed automatically in every Expo app. To use a React Native library in your project, import it from the `react-native` package in your code:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, paddingTop: 100 }}>
      <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Using Expo SDK Libraries

The Expo SDK picks up where the React Native core libraries end - it provides access to a lot of useful device and system functionality like audio, barcode scanning, camera, calendar, contacts, video, and so on. It also adds other powerful libraries like updates, maps, OAuth authentication tools, and more. For details on how we decide what goes into the Expo SDK, [read here](https://expo.fyi/whats-in-the-sdk).

To use a library from the Expo SDK, find the one you are looking for in the [API Reference](/versions/latest/) or through the documentation Search bar.

At the top of the page you will see a description of the library and a platform compatibility table. It tells you which platforms and environments the library is compatible with. It looks like this:

<PlatformsSection android emulator ios simulator web />

After the platform compatibility table, there will be an Installation section, with instructions that look like this:

<InstallSection packageName="expo-device" hideBareInstructions />

<br />

The `expo install` command will pick a version of the library that is compatible with your project and then use your JavaScript package manager (such as npm) to install it.

Next, under the API section the reference page will tell you how to import the library in your code:

```js
import * as Device from 'expo-device';
```

This section also lists all of the types, functions, and classes available. If you use TypeScript, you can see this information in your TypeScript-compatible code editor (such as Visual Studio Code) with autocompletion.

Now you can use the library in your project:

```js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as Device from 'expo-device';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, paddingTop: 100 }}>
      <Text>
        {Device.manufacturer}: {Device.modelName}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Using Third-Party Libraries

### Finding Third-Party Libraries

[React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory) is a searchable database of libraries built specifically for React Native. If the library that you are looking for is not provided by React Native or Expo then this is the best place to look first when trying to find a library for your app.

After React Native Directory, the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) is the next best place. The npm registry is the definitive source for JavaScript libraries, but the libraries that it lists may not all be compatible with React Native. React Native is one of many JavaScript programming environments, including Node.js, web browsers, Electron, and more, and npm includes libraries that work for all of these environments. Other libraries may be compatible with React Native, but not compatible with the Expo Go app. How do you figure this out?

### Determining Third-Party Library Compatibility

**Check React Native Directory**: find the library on the website (if it's there) and verify that it has a "‚úîÔ∏è Expo Go" tag. You can also enable the [filter by Expo Go](https://reactnative.directory/?expo=true) option to only show libraries that are compatible with the Expo managed workflow.

**Not listed on the directory?** find the project on GitHub, an easy way to do this is with `npx npm-home --github <package-name>`. For example, to open the GitHub page for react-native-localize you would run:

```bash
npx npm-home --github react-native-localize
```

Now check the following:

- Does it include an `ios` and/or `android/` directory?
- Does the README mention linking?
- Is it built specifically for Node.js, the web, electron, or another platform?

If you answered yes to any of these questions and the library is not part of the Expo SDK, this library may not be supported in Expo Go. You can go ahead and try it in a new project to be sure! Run `expo init` and add the library to the new project and try to use it. This is a great way to experiment with a library before including it in your project in all circumstances.

Many libraries you can use with Expo and React Native will not be compatible with Expo Go or `expo build:ios|android`. If you need any of them to build your app, you can create a [development build](../development/introduction.md) for your project using [EAS Build](../build/introduction.md) or [eject to the bare workflow](../workflow/customizing.md).

> üôè If you want some help determining library compatibility, [please create an issue on the React Native Directory repository](https://github.com/react-native-community/directory/issues/new/choose) and let us know. This will not just help you, it will help to ensure that other developers have an easy answer in the future!

### Installing a Third-Party Library

> üí° We recommend always using `expo install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn add` directly because it allows `expo-cli` to pick a compatible version of a library when possible and also warn you about known incompatibilities.

Once you have determined if the library is compatible, use `expo-cli` to install the package:

```bash
expo install @react-navigation/native
```

Be sure to follow the project website or README for any additional configuration and usage instructions. You can get to the README quickly using this command:

```bash
npx npm-home @react-navigation/native
```

If the module needs additional native configuration, you can do so using [config plugins](../guides/config-plugins.md).

If the module is not supported in Expo Go, at this point you should:

- Build your project [locally](../build-reference/local-builds.md) or with [EAS Build](../build/introduction.md)
- Create a [development build](../development/introduction.md)
