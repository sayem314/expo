You can use any native code you like in the bare workflow; the following lists specifically address whether the Expo SDK APIs (the APIs you will find in the "API Reference" section of this documentation) are supported by the bare workflow. Some are only available in the managed workflow currently, you can [jump to those](#only-available-in-managed-workflow-currently) if you like.

Refer to the bare workflow ["Up and Running"](hello-world.md) page to learn about [installing one of these packages](hello-world.md#install-an-expo-sdk-package) and [using Expo modules](hello-world.md#using-expo-modules).

## Available in bare and managed workflows

[Every module in the Expo SDK](/versions/latest/) is available in both bare and managed workflows, with the exception of those listed below.

## Only available in the bare workflow currently

[InAppPurchases](../versions/latest/sdk/in-app-purchases.md) is the only library in the Expo SDK that works exclusively in bare workflow projects. We're working on eliminating this restriction, [learn more](https://blog.expo.dev/expo-managed-workflow-in-2021-d1c9b68aa10).
