> üö® Electron support is an experimental community project, so the workflow is suboptimal and subject to breaking changes. If you find bugs please report them on [expo/expo-electron-adapter](https://github.com/expo/expo-electron-adapter/issues).

[Electron][electron] is a framework for creating desktop apps that run in a Chromium wrapper. Using Expo with Electron will enable you to use your existing components to build OSX, Windows, and Linux apps.

To simplify this we created the package `@expo/electron-adapter` which wraps [`electron-webpack`][electron-webpack] and adds support for Expo web and other universal React packages.

## üèÅ Setup

- Create a new Expo project - `expo init`
- Install - `yarn add -D @expo/electron-adapter`
- Bootstrap Electron - `yarn expo-electron`

  - Append electron generated files to the `.gitignore`
  - Install the required dependencies: `electron`, `@expo/webpack-config`, `react-native-web`, etc...
  - Create a new [`electron-webpack`][electron-webpack] config file
    `electron-webpack.js`

    ```js
    const { withExpoAdapter } = require('@expo/electron-adapter');

    module.exports = withExpoAdapter({
      projectRoot: __dirname,
      // Provide any overrides for electron-webpack: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack/blob/master/docs/en/configuration.md
    });
    ```

## ‚öΩÔ∏è Usage

### Starting a project

- Start the project with `yarn expo-electron start`, this will do the following:
  - Ensure that you have an `electron-webpack.js` file created in your root directory.
  - Disable security warnings (`ELECTRON_DISABLE_SECURITY_WARNINGS=1`)
  - Start two webpack processes, one for the main process, and one for the render process.

### Customizing the main process

- To reveal the main process (highly recommended) run - `yarn expo-electron customize`
  - This will generate the **electron/main/** and **electron/webpack.config.js** files for you to customize.
  - Everything running in the **electron/main/** folder is on a different process to the rest of your app. Think of this like the native code in the Expo Go app (but not really because it's JavaScript and simple).
- To revert back to the default main process or reset to the latest default template simply delete the `electron/` folder and the adapter will go back to using the hidden version.

### Building your project

`@expo/electron-adapter` doesn't do anything to streamline the build phase of Electron projects just yet. But until it does here is a guide for building projects using [`electron-builder`][electron-builder].

- Install the package with `yarn add -D electron-builder`
- Use the builder with: `yarn electron-webpack && yarn electron-builder --dir -c.compression=store -c.mac.identity=null` (`-c.compression=store` speeds the builds up a lot, delete this for actual production builds)
- Learn more about configuring your build here: [Configuring electron-builder][electron-builder-config]

## üß∏ Behavior

- Webpack now resolves files with **.electron.js** & **.web.js** extensions in that order. If you want to use `electron` features then put them in a file like **foo.electron.js**.
- Every universal package you have installed will be transpiled automatically, this includes packages that start with the name: `expo`, `@expo`, `@unimodules`, `@react-navigation`, `react-navigation`, `react-native`. You can add more by appending them to the array for key `expo.web.build.babel.include` in your **app.json** (this feature is experimental and subject to change).
